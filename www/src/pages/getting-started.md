#### Installation

To install via `npm`:
```bash
# npm install react-transition-replace --save
```
 or `yarn`:
```bash
# yarn add react-transition-replace
```

_The component is intended to work with `react-transition-group@2.x.x`
and utilises some of its components: `Transition` and `CSSTransition`._

#### CDN / External

Since react-transition-replace is fairly small, the overhead of including
the library in your application is negligible. However, in situations
where it may be useful to benefit from an external CDN when bundling,
link to the following CDN: https://unpkg.com/react-transition-replace/browser/react-transition-replace.min.js
